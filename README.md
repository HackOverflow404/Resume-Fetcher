This project automates the download, storage, and deployment of my resume from Google Docs to multiple local directories, including my Next.js portfolio.

It also auto-commits and pushes the updated resume to my GitHub repository to auto update the Next.js site.

The added bash command: `alias rupd='cd ~/Documents/Projects/fetch-resume/ && node index.js && cd -'` allows me to automate the entire process with a single command from anywhere.
